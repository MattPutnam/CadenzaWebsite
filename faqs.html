      <span class="titles">FAQS</span>

      <div class="faq_q">How do I use a pedal to trigger an event?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">If your keyboard has a spare pedal input, it's probably possible to use it directly. Plug the pedal in, open the
                         Input Monitor (Control | Show Input Monitor), see what kinds of signals it's sending, and set up a global trigger
                         to work with those. If you're out of pedal inputs or can't set the keyboard to send a usable signal, you can use
                         a pedal box from <a href="http://www.midisolutions.com/">MIDI Solutions</a> to cause the pedal to trigger any note.
                         A common thing to do is to set it to send a note beyond the range of your keyboard (for example, C#8). Even if
                         Cadenza isn't set to ever play anything with that note, it will still receive the MIDI message and can work with it.</div>

      <div class="faq_q">How do I get Cadenza to use a synthesizer that isn't listed?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">Cadenza uses plain text files to define synthesizers, their built-in and expansion patch banks, and the commands
                         necessary to switch patches. See the manual for the full specifications of these files, or take a look in the
                         resources folder to see how the existing ones work. If you're not comfortable doing this, send an email to
                         <a href="mailto:support@cadenzasoftware.com">support@cadenzasoftware.com</a> and we'll be happy to do it for you.
                         If you write your own and it works, send it to us so we can include it in future releases.</div>

      <div class="faq_q">What keyboards do you recommend?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">Anything that transmits MIDI (which is almost anything). If you're using multiple keyboards, it makes things easier
                         if the keyboard has the standard 5-pin MIDI OUT port, as opposed to USB. If you're in need of a cheap solution, the
                         <a href="http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Keystation88es.html">M-Audio Keystation series</a> is great.</div>

      <div class="faq_q">What synthesizers do you recommend?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">The Roland JV-1080 is the classic workhorse in the industry. Many musicals have been written around it, so if you're
                         doing one of those, it's the natural choice. They can be found used for around $200.</div>

      <div class="faq_q">What MIDI interfaces do you recommend?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">
        <p>For a 1x1 MIDI-to-USB cable, the only thing worth getting is the
           <a href="http://www.rolandus.com/products/productdetails.php?ProductId=1157">Roland UM-ONE</a>. Cheaper cables are unreliable in
           unpredictable and disastrous ways&mdash;some will drop a MIDI message when too many occur at once. This is an annoyance when it's
           a NOTE ON message that's dropped, and an embarrassing disaster if it's a NOTE OFF.</p>

        <p>If you have more than one input, then you have a few options. If 16 MIDI channels will be enough, the products from
           <a href="http://www.midisolutions.com/">MIDI Solutions</a> are a simple solution. They have several kinds of MIDI mergers which
           could not be any easier to use&mdash;they don't even require power.</p>

        <p>Another option is to use an interface with more connections, such as the ones from <a href="www.motu.com">MOTU</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq_q">What kinds of applications is Cadenza good for?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">Any kind of live performance by MIDI-enabled instruments. Cadenza was designed with musical theater in mind, but
                         could easily be used for anything else. So far, it has been used with upwards of 4 keyboards simultaneously, guitar,
                         drum pads, and <a href="http://www.alternatemode.com/malletkat_family.shtml">MalletKATs</a>.</div>

      <div class="faq_q">Why not just use Apple MainStage?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">MainStage is a good solution, but it requires two expensive things: A MacBook Pro with a lot of RAM, and good sample
                         libraries. Computers with modest amounts of RAM easily choke when trying to load samples, causing a brief gap in
                         response or ugly audio artifacts. Cadenza can run on just about any computer and is designed to work with hardware
                         synths or your keyboard's own built-in sounds, eliminating the sample loading problem.</div>
      
      <div class="faq_q">Why not just use Max or Pure Data?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">They offer tons of power, but are difficult to use for a musician that's not also a programmer. Cadenza offers all
                         of the most commonly used features and is much simpler to operate.</div>

      <div class="faq_q">I found a bug! Where do I report this?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@cadenzasoftware.com">support@cadenzasoftware.com</a>, and indicate if it's
                         preventing you from using the software or is just an annoyance. You can also submit a bug through
                         <a href="https://github.com/MattPutnam/cadenza">github</a>.</div>

      <div class="faq_q">I have a great idea for a feature! Where can I make the request?</div>
      <div class="faq_a">Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@cadenzasoftware.com">support@cadenzasoftware.com</a>. You can also submit
                         a feature request through <a href="https://github.com/MattPutnam/cadenza">github</a>.</div>
