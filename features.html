      <p>Cadenza is a free and simple software solution to your MIDI patching problems. Aside from the free software, all you need are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A MIDI-enabled keyboard (so pretty much any keyboard)</li>
        <li>A computer that can run Java (so pretty much any computer)</li>
        <li>A MIDI interface (you can get a simple MIDI-to-USB cable for around $40)</li>
        <li>A synthesizer (the only significant cost&mdash;although used synthesizers can often be found for only a few hundred dollars.
            See the <a href="faqs.html">FAQ</a> for hardware recommendations)</li>
      </ul>

      <span class="sectionheader">Cues and triggers:</span>

      <p>Cadenza can support any number of presets (called "cues") with arbitrarily complicated layers and splits&mdash;the only limit is the
         number of parts on your synthesizer. Most digital synthesizers have at least 16 parts, which is enough for almost any job. In addition
         to simply assigning patches to regions of keyboards, patches can also transpose, play entire chords off of single keys, use an arpeggiator,
         and more!</p>
      <p>In addition to these patch options, Cadenza can be set up to trigger many kinds of events off of any input. This input can be a note on the
         instrument, or any pedal or button on the instrument that sends a MIDI signal. Most commonly, an unused button, extra pedal (perhaps
         plugged into an unused expression input) or an unused key on the keyboard is set to advance to the next cue. However, these triggers
         can be configured per cue, so you can have each cue automatically advance to the next when a certain note is played.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, triggers can be set up to jump to any cue in the show, go back a cue (in case a cue was advanced mistakenly), send
         MIDI sysex commands, or perform a number of complex actions. These can be used to control many types of hardware, including effects units,
         lighting boards, and digital mixers. With the right equipment, you can have events in the music controlling all aspects of your performance!</p>

      <span class="sectionheader">Support for any kind of hardware:</span>

      <p>Cadenza doesn't care what kind of keyboard you have, as long as it sends MIDI. It doesn't need to have lots of built-in sounds, lots of
         sliders and knobs, or the ability to split into zones&mdash;it just listens to the notes being played and does the magic on its end. For
         this reason, just about any keyboard will do, even the cheapest MIDI controllers. No need for anything specialized or fancy. Cadenza
         also doesn't care what kind of instrument is generating the MIDI and is perfectly suited for managing drum pads, MIDI guitars and basses,
         wind controllers, or anything else you might have.</p>
      <p>Cadenza is also ready to work with just about any synthesizer out there. It comes preconfigured to support the most common models, and
         can easily be extended to support more by adding delegate files that tell Cadenza how to operate it. See the <a href="faqs.html">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>

      <span class="sectionheader">Find your hardware patches quickly and easily:</span>

      <p>No need to scroll through hundreds of presets on your synth module looking for the right string sound. Cadenza provides a simple
         interface for searching through your synth module's patches and previewing them. And if you decide to add an expansion card or swap out
         the module entirely, it's easy to replace all usages of an old patch with a new one.</p>

      <span class="sectionheader">Rehearsals made easy:</span>

      <p>Traditionally, performers work with hardware synths by programming the presets directly onto the module itself. Not only is this
         laborious to preset, but it's a pain to scroll through to a particular spot when rehearsing. Cadenza can simply jump to any spot in the show instantly.</p>
